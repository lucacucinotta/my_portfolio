## 🌐 Introduction

Hi, I'm Luca, and I'm here to introduce you to my new portfolio website. This website has the purpose to show to a potentially interested public who I am and what I can do, thanks to the "About" and "Projects" sections that contains somewhat about me and some of the projects realized by myself that I really enthusiast to show.
You can give a view to my toolkit and, if you want to contact me for any reason, you can compile the form at the end of the page and leave me your message. I'll be happy to reply.

The realization of this website is thanks to the last technologies that I learned during my Full Stack Development course. I've use React as framework for create all the sections that you can visit and Tailwind CSS, in combination with PostCSS and Prettier, as framework for take care of the style and responsiveness of the page. I've also used Framer Motion for the navbar and section's animation.
